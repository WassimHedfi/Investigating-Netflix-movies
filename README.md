# Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
In this project, you'll apply Python skills from Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science challenge. By diving into Netflix's movie data, you'll investigate if there's a trend of decreasing movie lengths over time. Additionally, you'll delve into the guest stars of "The Office," pinpointing those who appear in its most popular episode.

From foundational concepts like lists and loops to advanced tools like pandas and matplotlib, you'll employ a diverse range of techniques. The project also offers a chance to master exploratory data analysis, a vital data science skill, allowing you to manipulate raw data and extract meaningful insights from your visualizations. It's time to hit play and embark on this insightful journey!
